This CasperJS script lets you query Google for a keyword. Then it aggregates the related search queries in an Array and output the result to the console.

Run the script in your terminal in the following way :
casperjs ./related.js "your keyword"

That's it !

Tested with CasperJS version 1.1.0-beta3
